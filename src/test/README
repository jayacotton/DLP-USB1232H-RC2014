This code is used to perform an end to end test of the dlp circuit


The cpm end is a loop reader/writer that sends a data byte to the
unix end, the unix end echos the byte back to the cpm end.

At the cpm end we receive the byte and compair it to the sent byte,
differences are logged to the console.
